## To Do :

- Add basic controls initially (like using gesture to control up/down scrolling, play pause etc)

- Implement an easy-to-use virtual keyboard using gestures

## Update :

Though this method is very innovative, it does not give the necessary accuracy and stability in counting fingers realtime.
